# enviro-tweaks
My collections of tweaks for getting enviro working for me. These boards are great and al real pleasure to learn with.

## Enclosures

I wanted an indoor enclosure that could print without supports and support minor customisations. I ended up with an openSCAD model that allows:
- Adding cutout text to the lid (it is for indoor! :-));
- Parametric setting of height, numbert of rings, angle of rings and diameter;
- Prints without supports;
- No screws needed
